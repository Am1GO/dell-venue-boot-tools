This is a modified version of turl's tools to pack/unpack images from
https://github.com/turl/razr-i-boot-tools

This version of the tool should work with Dell Venue images.

#Since ZTE GXI and Dell Veneue do not store images in separate paritions, 
#a new tool was added to read the MBR info and dump the referenced images 
#from hidden part of /dev/block/mmcblk0 (first 100 MB).

Header checksum and length are recalculated to match modfied image. 

The utilities adapted from original project:

- dvenue_unpack - obtain kernel and compressed initrd from image (e.g. stock image from update.zip)


- dvenue_pack - IS NOT BUILT AS IT IS NOT WORKING DUE TO SIGNATUE IN IMAGE FILE. DON'T USE, IMAGE WON'T BOOT
(originally it should modify the image by providing user kernel and initrd image (user may specify image type))

New utility:
- dvenue_dump_images_pc - retreive images stored in hidden part of mmcblk0 
- dvenue_dump_images_s - static-linked version dumping images directly on phone from /dev/block/mmcblk0
